# 📚 LearnWithAboode – E-Learning Website

LearnWithAboode is a **fully responsive single-page e-learning website** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only**.
This project was created as an experiment and learning experience using **OpenAI Codex**, and it marks the **first time I built a full website with the help of AI**.

As a beginner in programming, this experience was eye-opening and inspiring.
